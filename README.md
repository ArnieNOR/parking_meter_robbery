# Parking Robbery

### About
Robbery script where a player can rob Parking Meters when they have a lockpick.

This is just a super easy script because this is my first ever script and its for me to learn.  
Im planning on adding support for multiple smaller robberies where you can get different items.

Target support: **ox_target** or **qb-target**  
Inventory support: **ox_inventory** or **qb-inventory**
